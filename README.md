# ToilnTrouble-Multi
This is the latest iteration of a card game about making potions, which uses an app to randomize the powers of various potion ingredients, and help users investigate them

Project plan
1) Recreate existing architecture using HTML and JS
    a) Edit Catalyst behavior so it randomizes every round. How can I control this?
    b) Draw the ingredient info from a CSV

2) Connect to back-end work with Walter

3) Implement new feature: enter a code to sync one's instance with another

4) Style with CSS

5) Bonus: allow note-taking within the app
